# Notes and checklists

* min val per cat option like min slopes per x?
* if p-values, don't do trials or instead combine to get stddev
* examine combining impacts, sigmas; same scale? what about when nonnormalized?
* p-values seems to get totally messed up importances
* combine pvalue=True and n_trials to get pvalues; no sep count
* add ignored to plots
* add impact to importance dataframe
* yearmade and modelid get reversed with density_weighted; see compute_importance()
