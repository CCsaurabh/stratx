# Notes and checklists

* min val per cat option like min slopes per x? outliers? didn't help ModelID
* add ignored to plots
* yearmade and modelid get reversed with density_weighted; see compute_importance(); pvalue=1.0?
  Seems that modelid with shuffled y is random and large
* timing experiment to see empirical complexity
* plots can't handle unnormalized data
* plots show rank then importance? option to sortby
* feature plot doesn't show error bars
