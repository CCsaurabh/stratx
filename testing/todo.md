# Notes and checklists

- [ ] min val per cat option like min slopes per x?
- [ ] if p-values, don't do trials or instead combine to get stddev
- [ ] examine combining impacts, sigmas; same scale? what about when nonnormalized?
- [ ] p-values seems to get totally messed up importances
- [ ] add ignored to plots
